    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups chopped fresh tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 slice onion</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a stockpot, over medium heat, combine the tomatoes, large slice of onion, garlic cloves, and chicken
            broth. Bring to
            a boil, and gently boil for about 20 minutes to blend all of the flavors. Remove from heat and run the
            mixture through a
            food mill into a large bowl, or pan. Discard any stuff left over in the food mill.</li>
        <li>In the now empty stockpot, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour to make a roux, cooking until
            the roux is
            a medium brown. Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture, so that no lumps form, then stir in the
            rest. Season
            with sugar and salt, and adjust to taste.</li>
    </ol>
